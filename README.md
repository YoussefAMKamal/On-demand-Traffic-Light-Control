# On-Demand Traffic Light Control Project
  This system is a traffic light system which include a button for pedestrian. When the pedestrian presses the button it forces the system on stopping the cars to help the pedestrian to cross the road. This system priority is the pedestrian crossing the road.
Traffic lights normally consist of three leds, sending meaning to drivers and riders through symbols and colors.
The regular traffic light colors are green, yellow, and red arranged in that order.
